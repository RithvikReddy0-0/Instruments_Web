## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/instrument-hub.git
    cd instrument-hub
    ```
    (If you're not using Git, simply download the `index.html`, `style.css`, `site-script.js`, and `app-script.js` files into a single folder.)

2.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
    Navigate to the project directory and open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari recommended).

    No build process or local server is strictly required for basic functionality as it's a client-side application, but running it through a simple local server (like VS Code's Live Server extension) can prevent potential issues with file paths or browser security policies in some cases.

## How to Play

*   **Navigate to the "Instruments" page.**
*   **Select an instrument** from the dropdown menu.
*   **Enable Sound:** Click anywhere on the instrument display area or press a mapped keyboard key to enable audio (this is a browser security requirement).
*   **Play:**
    *   **Mouse/Touch:** Click or tap on the interactive parts of the instrument (keys, strings, pads, bars).
    *   **Keyboard:** Use the keyboard shortcuts displayed in the "Keyboard Hints" tooltip next to the side character.
*   **Adjust Volume:** Use the volume slider.
*   **Use Metronome/Tuner:** These controls will appear for relevant instruments.

## Future Enhancements (Ideas)

*   **Sample-based sounds:** Incorporate real instrument samples for more realistic audio.
*   **Advanced Tuning:** Implement microphone input and pitch detection for the tuner.
*   **Recording Feature:** Allow users to record and playback their compositions.
*   **More Instruments:** Expand the collection of virtual instruments.
*   **Music Theory Helpers:** Add scales, chords, and other learning aids.
*   **MIDI Support:** Allow connection of MIDI controllers.
*   **Accessibility Improvements:** Further enhance ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
